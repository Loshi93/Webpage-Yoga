                <ul>2. Now exhale, and gently bend your body forward. Let your palms touch your feet. It might be difficult at first, so let your arms reach as far as possible. Your body shouldn’t be strained at any point.</ul>
                <ul>3. Your trunk should be placed close to your legs. Your forehead should touch your knees. But this comes with practice, and might be difficult initially. Just remember to listen to your body, and stop when it asks you to.</ul>
